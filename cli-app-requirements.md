# Cli App

The prototype proved quite successful but did have some problems... 

- Only tested on one android phone
- Only compatible with one 3d printer
- Dictionary contained some unrecognised words
- Not all words were entered in the time, i.e. some extra words were missed
- Directional
- Configuration awkward
- ADB is not fast

## The App

To improve this, the features of the prototype will be incorparated into a cli tool, to have a smoother experience

It will be built using poetry (if it can be installed on termux)
